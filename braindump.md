Welcome! I use this site to document my learnings and projects as I explore various technologies and build new things.

## About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with nearly 5 years of experience at M+ Software, specializing in building scalable enterprise solutions. Currently serving as a **Development Team Lead**, I manage cross-functional teams and oversee the development of SARA Hotel Service Management System, an enterprise-level SaaS platform.

My technical expertise spans across **Next.js, TypeScript, React, and PHP**, with a proven track record of delivering high-impact optimizationsâ€”including improving API performance by 92% and reducing page load times by 100x. I'm passionate about problem-solving, performance optimization, and mentoring team members to help them grow.

Previously, I've worked across various roles including Senior Developer, Business Analyst, and Project Manager, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the full software development lifecycle. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Universitas Indonesia and have published research on large-scale diabetic retinopathy datasets.

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring AI technologies, improving software engineering practices, and continuously learning new ways to build better products.
