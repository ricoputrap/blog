Welcome! I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and **Development Team Lead** at M+ Software with nearly 5 years of experience building SARA, an SaaS for managing day-to-day hotel operations using **Next.js**, TypeScript, React, and PHP. I use this site to document my learnings and projects as I explore various technologies and build new things.
