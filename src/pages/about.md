title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm **Rico Putra Pradana**, a **Full Stack Developer** and **Development Team Lead** at M+ Software with nearly 5 years of hands-on experience in building and scaling web applications.

I currently lead the development of **SARA**, a comprehensive SaaS platform designed to streamline day-to-day hotel operations. Working with technologies like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **PHP**, I've helped create solutions that make hotel management more efficient and user-friendly.

## What I Do

As a team lead, I balance technical development with mentoring and guiding my team. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and implementing best practices that help our team deliver high-quality software consistently.

## Beyond Code

I believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This blog serves as my personal space to document what I learn, share insights from my experiences, and explore new technologies. Whether it's diving into machine learning concepts, experimenting with new frameworks, or solving interesting technical challenges, I enjoy the process of learning and growing as a developer.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. Feel free to check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ricoputrap) or reach out if you'd like to discuss technology, development practices, or potential collaborations.
